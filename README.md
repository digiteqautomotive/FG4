# FG4 frame grabber cards

![FG4 product photo](FG4.webp)

Digiteq Automotive FrameGrabber 4 (FG4) is a PCIe card capable of capturing and
generating FPD-Link III and GMSL2/3 video streams as used in the automotive
industry.

The card has support for the Linux and Windows operating systems.

## Linux

On Linux a standard v4l2 interface is used to access the card. FG4-specific
settings are configured using _sysfs_. A FG4 card driver called `mgb4` is part
of Linux starting with version 6.7 of the kernel.

### Configuration

Several FG4-specific aspects may/must be configured in _sysfs_ to get/provide
the desired FPD-Link/GMSL2 streams. The whole configuration interface is
documented in the [admin-guide/media/mgb4.html](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/media/mgb4.html)
section of the Linux kernel's documentation.

To change any of the parameters simply write into the appropriate _sysfs_ files:

```console
$ echo 0 > /sys/class/video4linux/video0/color_mapping
```

As usual in Linux, permanent _sysfs_ configuration must be provided externaly
using a _UDEV_ configuration. See the [98-mgb4.rules](examples/UDEV/98-mgb4.rules)
file for some example configuration. Usually you only have to configure the
outputs[^1], the inputs are properly autodetected from the video streams.

[^1]: There is no (reliable/working) EDID-like mechanism in FPD-Link/GMSL2.

### Firmware update

For different modules (FPD-Link/GMSL), different card firmware is required. To
change/update the firmware use the
[fw-flash](https://github.com/digiteqautomotive/linux-flash) tool.
The latest firmwares are available at
[fg4.digiteqautomotive.com](https://fg4.digiteqautomotive.com/).

_A PC power cycle is required after flashing the card, a simple reboot is not sufficient!_

### API documentation

Everything except the FG4-specific configuration described above is controlled
using a standard [v4l2 API](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/media/v4l/v4l2.html).

### Sample applications

For a complex sample application see [DQ Viewer](https://github.com/digiteqautomotive/dqview),
a simple libVLC-based media player that is capable of configuring FG4 devices,
playing v4l2 camera streams as well as producing v4l2 video outputs sourced
by standard H264/MPEG video files.

Additionaly two simple examples how to use the FG4 cards from Python using
OpenCV are provided here. [cam.py](examples/v4l2/OpenCV/camera/cam.py) is a very basic
media player. [io.py](examples/v4l2/OpenCV/output/io.py) is a more advanced example of
streaming a video stream grabbed on input to an output while drawing a text overlay
over it.


## Windows

On Windows a standard DirectShow interface is used to access the card.
FG4-specific settings are configured using _Windows COM_.

### Configuration

Several FG4-specific aspects may/must be configured using _Windows COM_ to
get/provide the desired FPD-Link/GMSL2 streams. See the
[COM example code](examples/COM/fg4.cpp) for how to do this. For all available
options see the [fg4.idl](examples/COM/fg4.idl) IDL file.

### API documentation

Everything except the FG4-specific configuration described above is controlled
using a standard [DirectShow API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directshow/directshow).
